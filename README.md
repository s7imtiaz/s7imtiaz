### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a data scientist working at Lyft Canada where I'm part of the Driver Data Science team. My job mainly centers around the design, development, testing, and deployment of Cloud-based machine learning products while delivering a seamless user experience for the different business units in the company looking to leverage the data products developed by my team.

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Koin Technologies Ltd. where I worked on both supervised and unsupervised learning problems such as identifying fraudulent transactions on a payments app and detecting user churn on the app. I also participate regularly in hackathons -  both internal (company-wide) and external. In the last hackathon I participated (organized by TD Bank Canada) - my team deveopoled a retail payments app with focus on redirecting user cashback amounts to both international and local charitable organizations.

I also completed a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering where my final year design project centred around optimization of Lithium-sulphur battery management systems to provide higher range.

Languages I've coded in:
Python SQL JS
